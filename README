#  Handcrafted WP Starter Theme http://randyjensenonline.com/thoughts/handcrafted-wp-starter-theme/

## Changelog

### v 0.8.6 : April 18th, 2011

## Huge Thanks:

Ian Stewart for his Toolbox theme and Paul Irish for his HTML5 
Boilerplate.

## Recent Changes (0.8.6)

2. Modified the code for metabox visibility using the remove_post_type_support function provided natively by wordpress.
3. Some other small changes

## Recent Changes (0.8.5)

All changes from @alettieri
1. Small change to loop.php on line 26, reflecting change in Ian Stewart's Toolbox theme

## Recent Changes (0.8.4)

1. Added code to functions.php to remove admin bar in 3.1

## Recent Changes (0.8.3)

1. Removed Modernizr and added Remy Sharp's HTML5shiv instead. So few people need all the awesome power of Modernizr, I think this makes sense.

3. Was referencing jQuery 1.4.3 locally in the footer but the bundled version was 1.4.2. Fixed.
